Hi, I'm Marsani, a Full-Stack developer from Indonesia.
My primary tools of choice includes:

Kotlin / Android Studio
React / HTML / CSS
Python / PHP / Nodejs
Linux / MacOS / Windows
PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB
Trello / Discord / Moodle
Beyond coding, I'm passionate about the world of technology, particularly in software development, system administration, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. An outside hobbies of technology are reciting the Quran and studying religion, I try to live a balanced life.

While I have some preferred tools, I always choose the best one for the job, even if it's not on my usual list. My goal is to find the right solution for each project.
